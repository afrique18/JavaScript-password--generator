# JavaScript-password--generator

# Description
Tasked with modifying a starter code to allow eployees to generate a random password based on a selected criteria. To complete the assignment, I worked on implementing examples from class lectures with little success. I thought by spending a bit more time rewatching class lectures, and modeling the steps in the examples would do, but it still didn't click. I scheduled a tutoring session, but still wasn't able to grab the concept. The assignment is currently above my level of computational thinking, but I am committed to getting to that level.
## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
